Sure! Here's a concise recap of how the bird identification model works:

### Overview of the Model

1. **Purpose**: The model aims to differentiate individual birds from video recordings by analyzing both visual and audio data. It can count the number of unique individuals in each video and identify the same individuals across multiple videos.

### Components

1. **Data Input**:
   - **Visual Data**: Frames extracted from videos (images of the birds).
   - **Audio Data**: Corresponding audio clips containing bird calls or sounds.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - **Early Fusion**: Combines visual and audio features early in the processing pipeline.
   - **Visual Feature Extractor**: Uses a pre-trained ResNet-50 model to extract features from the video frames.
   - **Audio Feature Extractor**: A simple CNN processes the audio data, which is converted into spectrograms.
   - **Combined Features**: Outputs from the visual and audio networks are concatenated and passed through a fully connected layer to generate embeddings representing each input.

3. **Training Process**:
   - The model is trained using a dataset of paired video frames and audio clips.
   - A loss function (e.g., MSELoss) is used to optimize the model's weights based on the output embeddings.
   - The model is trained on a GPU for efficiency.

4. **Inference**:
   - After training, the model can be loaded to analyze new video and audio data.
   - For each video, it generates embeddings and counts unique individuals based on their embeddings.
   - It also compares embeddings across videos to determine how many individuals are the same.

5. **Output**:
   - The model provides:
     - The number of unique individuals in each video.
     - The number of the same individuals identified across multiple videos.

### Summary

This model effectively integrates both visual and auditory information to differentiate between individual birds, making it a powerful tool for wildlife monitoring and research. Its design leverages modern deep learning techniques, allowing it to handle complex multimodal data. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!




I've organized the entire implementation into two separate scripts: one for training and one for inference. Each script will import shared components (the dataset and model definitions) from a common module.

### Project Structure

Here’s how you can organize your project:

```
bird_identification/
│
├── model.py              # Contains the model and dataset definitions
├── training.py           # Script for training the model
└── inference.py          # Script for using the trained model
```

### 1. `model.py`

This file contains the model and dataset definitions.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.data import Dataset

# Custom Dataset to handle frames and audio
class BirdDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, frames, audio_clips):
        self.frames = frames  # List of frames
        self.audio_clips = audio_clips  # Corresponding audio clips

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.frames)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        frame = self.frames[idx]
        audio_clip = self.audio_clips[idx]
        return frame, audio_clip

# CNN Model for early fusion of audio and visual features
class EarlyFusionModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(EarlyFusionModel, self).__init__()
        
        # Visual feature extractor (ResNet)
        self.visual_cnn = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
        self.visual_cnn.fc = nn.Identity()  # Remove the classification layer
        
        # Audio feature extractor (simple CNN)
        self.audio_conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 16, kernel_size=(3, 3))
        self.audio_conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=(3, 3))
        self.audio_fc = nn.Linear(32 * 6 * 6, 128)  # Adjust based on your input dimensions
        
        # Fully connected layer for combining features
        self.fc = nn.Linear(2048 + 128, 256)  # Combining visual and audio features

    def forward(self, frame, audio):
        # Process visual input
        visual_features = self.visual_cnn(frame)
        
        # Process audio input (assuming audio is already a spectrogram)
        audio = self.audio_conv1(audio)
        audio = nn.ReLU()(audio)
        audio = self.audio_conv2(audio)
        audio = nn.ReLU()(audio)
        audio = audio.view(audio.size(0), -1)  # Flatten
        audio_features = self.audio_fc(audio)
        
        # Combine features
        combined_features = torch.cat((visual_features, audio_features), dim=1)
        output = self.fc(combined_features)
        return output

# Count unique individuals based on combined embeddings
def count_unique_individuals(embeddings, threshold=0.5):
    unique_embeddings = []
    for emb in embeddings:
        if not any(torch.dist(emb, u_emb) < threshold for u_emb in unique_embeddings):
            unique_embeddings.append(emb)
    return len(unique_embeddings)
```

### 2. `training.py`

This script is responsible for training the model.

```python
# training.py
import torch
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from model import BirdDataset, EarlyFusionModel  # Import model and dataset

def train_model(model, dataloader, criterion, optimizer, num_epochs=10):
    model.train()
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for frames, audio_clips in dataloader:
            frames = frames.cuda()  # Move frames to GPU
            audio_clips = audio_clips.cuda()  # Move audio clips to GPU
            
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            audio_tensor = torchaudio.transforms.Spectrogram()(audio_clips.unsqueeze(1)).cuda()  # Convert audio to spectrogram
            outputs = model(frames, audio_tensor)
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)  # Define `labels` accordingly
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
        print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}, Loss: {loss.item()}')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load your video frames and audio clips here
    frames_video1 = [...]  # List of frames from video 1
    audio_clips_video1 = [...]  # Corresponding audio clips for video 1
    frames_video2 = [...]  # List of frames from video 2
    audio_clips_video2 = [...]  # Corresponding audio clips for video 2

    # Create dataset and dataloader
    dataset = BirdDataset(frames_video1 + frames_video2, audio_clips_video1 + audio_clips_video2)
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=8, shuffle=True)

    # Initialize model, loss function, and optimizer
    model = EarlyFusionModel().cuda()  # Move model to GPU
    criterion = nn.MSELoss()  # Adjust based on your task
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

    # Train the model
    train_model(model, dataloader, criterion, optimizer, num_epochs=10)

    # Save the model
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'early_fusion_model.pth')
```

### 3. `inference.py`

This script is responsible for loading the trained model and performing inference.

```python
# inference.py
import torch
from model import EarlyFusionModel, BirdDataset, count_unique_individuals

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load the trained model
    model = EarlyFusionModel().cuda()  # Move model to GPU
    model.load_state_dict(torch.load('early_fusion_model.pth'))
    model.eval()  # Set to evaluation mode

    # Load your video frames and audio clips for inference
    frames_video1 = [...]  # List of frames from video 1
    audio_clips_video1 = [...]  # Corresponding audio clips for video 1
    frames_video2 = [...]  # List of frames from video 2
    audio_clips_video2 = [...]  # Corresponding audio clips for video 2

    # Process videos for inference
    embeddings_video1 = []
    for frame, audio in zip(frames_video1, audio_clips_video1):
        with torch.no_grad():
            audio_tensor = torchaudio.transforms.Spectrogram()(audio.unsqueeze(0)).cuda()  # Add batch dimension and move to GPU
            output = model(frame.unsqueeze(0).cuda(), audio_tensor)  # Add batch dimension for frame and move to GPU
            embeddings_video1.append(output)

    embeddings_video2 = []
    for frame, audio in zip(frames_video2, audio_clips_video2):
        with torch.no_grad():
            audio_tensor = torchaudio.transforms.Spectrogram()(audio.unsqueeze(0)).cuda()  # Add batch dimension and move to GPU
            output = model(frame.unsqueeze(0).cuda(), audio_tensor)
            embeddings_video2.append(output)

    # Count unique individuals using combined embeddings
    unique_count_video1 = count_unique_individuals(embeddings_video1)
    unique_count_video2 = count_unique_individuals(embeddings_video2)

    # Count same individuals across videos
    combined_embeddings = embeddings_video1 + embeddings_video2
    same_individuals = count_unique_individuals(combined_embeddings)

    print(f'Video 1 unique individuals: {unique_count_video1}')
    print(f'Video 2 unique individuals: {unique_count_video2}')
    print(f'Same individuals across videos: {same_individuals}')
```

### Summary

- **`model.py`**: Contains the dataset and model definitions, which are shared between the training and inference scripts.
- **`training.py`**: Responsible for training the model and saving it to a file.
- **`inference.py`**: Loads the trained model and performs inference to count unique individuals.

### Additional Considerations

- Ensure that you properly load your video frames and audio clips in both scripts.
- The model is set to use a GPU with `.cuda()`, so ensure you have the necessary NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit installed.
- Adjust the input data dimensions, loss function, and other parameters according to your specific dataset and task requirements.
